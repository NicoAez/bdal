- 40.000.000 elements
- 2 hash functions
- array b size of 200.000.000

a) What error probability can Joe expect?
(1-e^(-2*40.000.000/200.000.000))^2 = 0,10860

b) How many hash functions should Joe use to minimize the error probability?
minimum is at k = ln2 * m/n => 3,465 => 4 (eher abrunden)

c) What fraction of B do we expect to be filled after the insertion of those 40.000.000 elements, with two hash functions?
probabilty of a single bit being set is 1-(1-1/m)^(kn) = 0.32967
